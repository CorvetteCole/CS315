# About
This program simulates trains at a switching station given three command line arguments and some random integers piped in. These arguments are, in order, NUM_TRAINS, STARTING_CARS, and MAX_STEPS.
Respectively these refer to the amount of trains, the amount of cars each train shall start with, and the maximum iterations the program shall run.

## Extras
I originally set out to create a generic type DoublyLinkedList and succeeded, but have one hacky workaround called int getValue(). This class should not be in the DoublyLinkedList.h file and while I recognize this, I did not have time to fix it.

# Running
use ```make run``` to compile and run this program.
